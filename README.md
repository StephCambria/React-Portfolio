## Description
A simple front-end portfolio application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), and deployed via [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages). This project is a continuation of a previous one made with only HTML and CSS:

Because this new portfolio is built using React, the header, navbar, and footer are rendered on each page, even on the mobile version!


## Installation
This app is deployed through [Github Pages](https://stephcambria.github.io/React-Portfolio/).

## Usage
* When a user opens this app, they will see a header, navbar, and footer on every page:

* Users will be navigated to the about section by default:

* When viewing the portfolio, users will see sample images of the application, as well as icons that will redirect to the Github repository and deployed application (or demo video if the app is back-end only):

* The contact page has a simple name, email, and text field. Currently, because this application only utilizes the front-end of React, it is not possible to actually send anything. However, if a user tries to anyway, an error message will appear:

* Lastly, the resume page contains an education timeline:

* As well as a brief list of skills, and a function to download a PDF version of the resume:

Additionally, this application is mobile-friendly.
